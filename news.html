          <p id="content4">The Anaheim Ducks defeat the San Jose Sharks at the SAP center
          on Saturday 3/18 with a final score of 2-1. The win helps the Ducks claim
         sole possesion of second place in the pacific division and helps close
        gap between them and the first place Sharks to only 4 points. The game
        was a hard fought battle with a playoff feel and thanks to Johnathan
        Bernier stopping 33/34 shots helped lead the Ducks to victory. Bernier
        started his 10th game out the last 11 played by the club since Gibson was
        injured on February 20th in Arizona. The Ducks next game is at home
        against the Edmonton Oilers on Wednesday the 22nd at 7pm.</p>
